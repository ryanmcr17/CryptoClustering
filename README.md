# CryptoClustering

## Unsupervised Machine Learning homework/challenge: Analysis of data on price changes over various periods of time for several different cryptocurrencies.

### Uses K-Means to cluster cryptocurrencies, uses Elbow method to identify ideal numbers of clusters based on resulting inertia, uses Standard Scaling and compares results using all the features/dimensions in the original dataset vs using just 3 principal components identified by PCA.
